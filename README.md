# No more "Load more" buttons on github

Annoyed that `^F` does not work in long github discussions?
Tired from clicking "Load more" over and over again?
This extension is for you!

# Development

NB: I have no idea how to make extensions. You might know better than me. 

[`web-ext`](https://github.com/mozilla/web-ext) is pretty cool for running the extension.

The code as-written is pretty hacky, but it does work.
